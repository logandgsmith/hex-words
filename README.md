# Hex Words
Finds words in a wordlist that can be expressed in hexadecimal numbers. Rewrite of a script I did a while back so that I could try out the `clap` CLI library 

# What is this
Reimplementing hex-words.py script in Rust
This script attempts to find English words that can be expressed with hexadecimal numbers.
I initially wrote this since I met this guy who went by 0xb7ade (hexblade) and wanted to see what
other names you could make like this.

# Usage
`cli-test [OPTIONS] <PATH>`
